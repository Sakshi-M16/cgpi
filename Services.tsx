      question: "What is the difference between a 'modular' and a 'portable' building?",
      answer: "A portable building is a stand-alone, self-contained building that is delivered in one piece by road and installed on site ready for immediate use. A modular building is constructed from two or more individual building modules. The modules are delivered to site by road, craned into position and connected together to create buildings of any size, with multiple storeys, to meet individual requirements."
    },
    {
      question: "What are your buildings made from?",
      answer: "CGP Infratech buildings are constructed with a steel outer wall, steel roof and galvanised steel floor frame. The walls are injected with foam insulation to give them a high thermal efficiency. This method of construction provides you with a building that requires very little maintenance and offers a high degree of comfort, all year round."
    },
    {
      question: "What preparations do I need to make before delivery?",
      answer: "You will need to keep access to the site completely clear of obstructions, allowing enough space for the vehicle delivering the building. Suitable foundations or a level hard-standing area must be available to accommodate the building. CGP Infratech will advise you on these matters during a site inspection."
    },
    {
      question: "What type of foundations will my CGP Infratech building require?",
      answer: "This depends on the surface the building will be standing on, and the type of building. Portable buildings that will be located on hard standing will only require shims. For other surfaces, or for modular buildings, only pad foundations are necessary. The foundations required will depend on the site conditions, the building weight and floor loads, so we will always advise you on your individual requirements."
    },
    {
      question: "How are CGP Infratech buildings delivered?",
      answer: "We will make all arrangements for the delivery of your building. Modular and portable buildings are transported by road on a flat-bed lorry or trailer platform and positioned using a lorry-mounted or standard crane. Modular buildings are then mechanically moved into position using lifting eyes."
    },
    {
      question: "What can you do to enhance the security of my modular or portable building?",
      answer: "A range of optional extras is available to enhance the security of your building and prevent break-ins. These range from steel shutters and window guards to intruder alarm systems."
